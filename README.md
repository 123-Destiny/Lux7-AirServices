# Lux7-AirServices

This repositiory is dedicated to demonstrating my final project for the ServiceNow NextGen Professionals Externship.

I collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure successful implementation of this ServiceNow project.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the final project my group mates and I created a scoped application using Studio Application.
We were contracted by Luxary7, LLC. to provide a solution for increased service delivery demands and enhanced client UI experience. 

Accomplishments:

Configured a Service Portal to showcase services available to clients and knowledge bases with corresponding articles

Further enhanced our project by:

Creating and updating workflows, UI policies, system notification, and client scripts
Creating update sets to manage instance migration.
Automating Lux7 item orders fulfillment and deployment process, including emails to customers when a new order is received and after their order has been shipped
